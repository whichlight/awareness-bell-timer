# Awareness Bell Timer 
This is a simple timer I use to keep track of time and remember to take breaks. The default sound is a meditation bell I have that I recorded. I was using an online meditation timer to mark out intervals of working time and I wanted one that I could easily run in the terminal. 

## Installation
Install mplayer. This is what will play the sound. The script runs in bash. 

## Usage 
Add the script to your path. To run, type `bell.sh`. This will run the timer for 30 minutes. 
To change the amount of minutes, enter that number as the first argument after the command. So for 10 minutes, write `bell.sh 10`.
